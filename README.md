# Stock Analysis

In this project, I analyzed a series of stocks for three years. The VBA script attached analyzes the spreadsheet and returns a table of summary information, then finds the stocks with the greatest positive and negative changes as well as the stock with the greatest annual total volume traded. 

##### Feedback on Assignment
###### "Hey Haley, Thank you for re-submitting this assignment! Congratulations on an outstanding homework assignment! You demonstrated your ability to write VBA code and complete the assignment with exceptionally well-performing code. Great work with conditional formatting of the code where you did an excellent job in creating the ticker symbol, the volume of stock, and the open and close price. What you can do is add comments to explain the purpose of the code and write a more detailed GitHub README of the code that serves well for you in the future as well. Great job for attempting the bonus section. Overall, all outputs match stock analysis, and you demonstrated abilities in the looping mechanism while storing all values. This is a really great job!
